Let's make a blank box. Nothing is inside yet so there is no contrast. I put 100 elements here and they have inner Δt. After Δt, they change its property. I calculate this lim Δt→0 It is a noisy environment. They barely exist but their property is always changing even their position. I pick one, and I name it A and I manipulate its inner Δt =1. It starts to have a relation or contrast between A and noise (emergence of contrast Z).


In Formal Language

Let S = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ} be a set of deforming nodes under internal Δtᵢ.

Noise-field N: a system S where no persistent contrast function exists across elements.

We can define proto-existence and proto-meaning: 
μ(A):=Δt→ϵlim[∃Z:C(At,At+Δt,Z) is stable] 

i, lim Δt→0: D(xᵢ_t, xᵢ_{t+Δt}) ≠ 0 (i.e. change), but ∄ C(xᵢ, xⱼ, Z) ⇒ System = noise 
Even if change exists (i.e., local dynamics are nonzero), if no stable contrast C(xᵢ, xⱼ, Z) can be defined, then the system remains unstructured, and thus meaningless — a noise-field.

Let A ∈ S and ∃ Δt_A ≠ Δtᵢ, ∀i ≠ A: Then ∃ Z such that: C(A, xᵢ, Z) becomes definable. 
∃Z:C(A,xi,Z)= Defined ⇒ A exists Z = contrast between A and the noise-field.

Δt, continuity is a fundamental element of all existence and meaning. The continuity is the flip side of the same phenomena, called rupture. 

Clarification: A latent structure will be treated as noise since there is no observable continuity.
