### Sub Principle 4: Rupture of continuity in CT:

Global Rupture
    R(me,me', ¬observation, memory) = true ; you're wearing different clothes, but the main global continuity is preserved.
    R(me,me', observation, ¬memory)=false ; you see you and it's transforming in continuum but your memory doesn't ensure who you were before at all.

Local Rupture
    This is called A but I don't know why.
    “Rocky Mountain Oysters” maintains global continuity within the language without local continuity, which is your linguistic knowledge.

Physics of Rupture 1
    (A ≉ A | +contrast) = rupture ; total rupture
    (A ≉ A | +contrast) ≈ rupture ; total to partial rupture
    (A ≉ A | +contrast) ~ rupture ; qualified as rupture

    Example1 :
        (me ≉ me′ | +contrast: trauma) = rupture
        Meaning: “I’m not who I used to be.”

    Example2 :
        (man≉man' | hospital) = rupture

Physics of Rupture 2:

    (A ~ A′ | X) → False 　
    Even though A ≈ A′ in essence, something in axis X makes them non-homeomorphic. 　

    (me ≉ me′ | +contrast: trauma) = rupture
    (me ~ me′ | time) = identity

    Example1:
        (childhood home ~ childhood home′ | return) → False
        Meaning: Return to the house, but it’s no longer home.

    Example2:
        (man≉man' | hospital)
        Meaning: “I’m not who I used to be.”

Frame Rupture

    Not explicitly observed continuity cannot exist. As an example, we introduce the concept of the forgotten dead. The same entity as bones for example, yet it is no longer c-topological. You might see a white powder on the beach but you won’t recognize it as a bones nor human.
    This mechanism is that differentiation for defining concepts is observation + contrast. The forgotten dead lacks the vital element, continuity under observation. However, this does not deny the possibility there is a latent continuity, so this should be interpreted as another local rupture.
