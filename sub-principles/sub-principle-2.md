### Sub principle 2: Transcendence is Coherent Deformation Across Higher Dimensions:

In Formal Language:
∃x, x′: M(x,Z_T) = x′ ∧ C(x, x′, Z_T) = true ∧ Z_T ∉ EG

In CTL:
T(x) = M(x, x′,Z) | C(x, x′, Z) = true, where Z ∉ direct observable frame (Z ∉ EG)

This allows concepts to “dream,” “project,” or become meaningful through non-literal deformation (e.g., becoming a singer, loving a fictional character, you could be).
