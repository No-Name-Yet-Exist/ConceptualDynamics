Conceptual Dynamics as Conceptual Topology


This is the draft of conceptual dynamics. This treats how concepts behave in the conceptual space and how they are restricted. This offers the principles and the test use cases of this theory.
Note: Some use cases cannot be empirically tested yet due to its nature such as emotions. Please be aware that those are the test application to see the extension of this theory.

概念力学は概念が概念空間においてどのように振る舞い、どのようにその動作が制限されているかを記述します。基本定理系となぜ仏壇が人として扱われうるかやHeraclitusなどのテスト用例を記載しています。
※感情などのいくつかの用例については実証的根拠を示すのが困難です。
　あくまでもテストケースとしての理解をお願い致します。
※この概念力学体系はブラッシュアップ及び精緻化が必要な草稿段階です


# The Structure of Conceptual Dynamics

    Reality / World　
    Conceptual Dynamics (運動・変化・存在の物理)
    Conceptual Topology (存在間の配置と接続の構造)
    Z(Contrast / Context) : Meaning Space

Currently Conceptual Dynamics and Conceptual Topology are mixed,
so the hard physics need to be separated to Conceptual Dynamics.
Conceptual Topology As Conceptual Dynamics


# Mathematical topology to Conceptual topology
You are on the train and look at a building. It's changing the shape from rectangular to different shape but looks epistemologically identical to you as one object. This is because you perform topological computation in your mind. As long as its continuity is preserved under observation or your memory, it's the same object. But how far can this go? You break a cup and you might call it a broken cup. Why do you call it "broken cup", instead of fragmented pieces? This is because it is conceptually reversible but just mathematically irreversible, more precisely conceptually homeomorphic. This goes on about yourself, you in the past and current you are homeomorphic, thus you can identify two people in the classical sense as a one person, continued transformation. The conceptual topology doesn't treat what it is but how it is, just like mathematical topology and this could open up a new perspective to look at the world.
