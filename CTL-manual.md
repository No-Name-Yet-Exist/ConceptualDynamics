# Abbreviations CT Conceptual Topology:

CTP: Conceptual Topological Space
EG: Euclidean Geometry means formal logic
CTG: CT Geometry
Key concepts

a. Node (N)
An entity with deformable structure or calculated target — could be object, self, concept. Usually, it is represented by a word but you can treat (A,B | Z ) as a node too.

b. Contrast Frame (F)
Axis or condition of observation: time, culture, philosophy etc. This has local frame and global frame. Without clarification, it is treated as local. So C(human ~ human’ | glass)=false since there is no evident morphic path to connect A and B. But you specify as global C(human ~ human’ | glass_global) = valid as a metaphor for example. But you cannot get true/false. It leaves potential multiple interpretations.

c. Morph Map (M)
Assumed continuity or projected continuity. As a function, it deforms structure while preserving relational identity.

d. Morphic Path
Dog can be homeomorphic with cat but it needs to trace a morphic path like mammal

e. Morphic System
The interconnected morphic paths or multiple frames. (human ~ man | mammal, gender, category)

f.Morphic identity
The preserved structure of concepts, the continuing identity through deformation. You need to specify it as an identity not to be confused with a frame, which is variable. (unicellular organism ~ human | gene_id) ; gene is the morphic identity here.
Summary: Morphic Path (local) / Morphic System(global) / Morphic identity(what gets preserved)

g.CTS:
the conceptual space where you perform these operations.

h.CTG:
the conceptual space but this focuses on the constraints by the space.

i.EG
Euclidean Geometry means formal logic and its rules.


# Definition of symbols for CT Language (CTL):

~ : Homeomorphism — structural similarity under CT deformation

≈ : Approximation or perceptual similarity (non-formal)

=: identical even in formal logic

≉ : Topological rupture — no preserved continuity

≁: Partial preservation of continuity (not as continuing as ~)

| : Given contrast frame — axis or observation context. You put a morphic path/system, frame and morphic identity This ensures the deformation is not arbitrary.

A‘: Changed state Me' could be me in the past, in the fire, simply different me.

¬: absence or place where ruptured

Δt : Time-delta — deformation through temporal contrast

Local: phenomenological view or local Z

Global: more extensive Z, which theoretically can include local Z too.

# CTL Functions:

You can add any functions following PCM defined below.

EP(x, t, Axes) : Euclidean Projection — x rendered in classical EG

T(x) : Transcendence Mapping — higher morphism of x, projection of x

C(A, A′, Z) : Comparative continuity — A and A′ homeomorphic in Z 　

R(A,B, Z_local, X_global, ….): Rupture detection

D(A,B): distance function which quantifies morphic path

M(A,B,Z): Deformation Function. This map the A to B. M(cat,dog,mammal)
