### Core principle 3: CT is Not What It Is, But How It Persists

For any entity x,
x ∈ CT ⇔ ∃ M, Z: C(x, M(x), Z) = true
Core principle 4: Multidimensionality of ruptured state

Rupture Event R(A, B, Z) = ¬C(A, B, Z) ∧ C(A, A′, Z′) ∧ C(B, B′, Z′)
Rupture is failure of continuity in one Z but not in another.

CTL example (Local)
If C(A, B, Z) = false, Then A ≉ B | Z (rupture of morphic identity)
Rupture is where structure can no longer be smoothly deformed between states under Z.
