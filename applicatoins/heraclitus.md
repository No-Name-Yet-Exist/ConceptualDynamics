# Heraclitus statement was a problem of CT:

"No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man." by Heraclitus is a c-topological question.

The river is not the river when you step in. Even if you are different.
instead (riverriver' | preserved continuum) â‡” (manman' | preserved continuum)

so i say (me ~ me' | identity), i exist as a homeomorphism to my eyes.
me now and me tomorrow aren't the same person yet it's the same person under a preserved continuum.
