# what is interaction?

Other in CT = (X ~ X′ | preserved structure across Δt + responsive deformation)

Interaction requires to establish shared CT state/model, otherwise you wont understand another vice versa.
Interaction = (Self ~ Other | CT Space of your mind)

Miscommunication=C(your CT ~ another's CT | CT Space of your mind) =false
"i dont get you" vice versa.

I love an anime girl.
C(anime girl ~ human | person A's CT Space) = true

but for B
C(anime girl ~ human | person A's CT Space) = false

The morphic path to reach anime girl to human is missing in B so it becomes unintelligible.
Strange = C(You, Other, dominant morphic path/system) = False
“You’re weird for loving that anime girl.”
They’re saying: “I can’t find a morphic path from me to her like you can.”
