# CT projection onto Euclid geometry.

First we need to understand this: CT religion

why is a tombstone a person? | religion
premise: Soul ~ man
where{
human = (object ~ vehicle ~ capsule ~ body | body ) + soul | religion
}

man = human
man ~ { (object ~ vehicle ~ capsule ~ body | body ) + soul}

man ~ (tombStone + soul) ; since tomb Stone = object
(man ~ tombStone | soul)
A: tombStone ~ man

from the understanding of tomb stone ~ person, i deduced people live in CT geometry.
"she lives on in our memories" = false | EG (logical standpoint)
"she lives on in our memories" = true | CTG (high dimensional standpoint)

### What is Life

Hypothesis: Life in CT = (X ~ X′ | preserved structure across Δt + Responsive deformation)
This explains why some people can think Earth is alive or on the lineage of Life.
