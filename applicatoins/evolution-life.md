# Evolution reinterpreted in CT:

Firstly, evolution is adaptation. If we accept this definition, we can reinterpret it in CT as follows.

Adaptation = ability to deform under Δt while preserving function/identity.
Note: there might be only genes which are left in the quite long term, yet it satisfies the defitnion.

Evolution(x, t₀ → tₙ) = loop(C(xᵢ, xᵢ₊₁, Zᵢ)) for i ∈ [0, n)

Now I say:
(unicellular organism ~ me | Evolution) ; adaptation through CT deformation Δt while preserving its continuity

I can say this too.
(reaction to stimulus ~ transformation | adaptive function)
Note: A unicellular organism adapts to stimuli (contrast) while maintaining its identity
(cell_t1 ~ cell_t2 | function)

human adapts to social, emotional, philosophical Δt while maintaining identity
(self_t1 ~ self_t2 | selfhood)

### Classic Darwinian in CT:
"Evolution is the structural fit (homeomorphism ~) between genes and their environment, under the condition of survival."
Evolution = (gene pool ~ environment | survival)
Note: The genes which could not survive goes back to the static background.

### New Darwinian in CT
(morphic identity ~ morphic identity (Δt) | adaptive continuity )
EP((morphic identity ~ morphic identity (Δt) | adaptive continuity ), time, functionality/figures) = Spices

If we generalize this, the fundamental definition of existence might be as follows.
(A ~ A(Δt) | X)
