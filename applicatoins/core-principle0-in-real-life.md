# Core principle 0 in real life

The problem is that we don't live in the world with infinitesimal ΔT (Time until next iteration). It's far longer than that. Yet it still governs us. If you look at Shibuya Crosswalk, they are chaotically crossing with much longer ΔT and this ΔT is even variable. Here you pick one person and pay attention, which automatically allocates longer ΔT relative to others. Suddenly person A gets contrasted and becomes recognizable and even tractable. And the most important thing is that A is changing through ΔT
