# what is empathy?

If:
    Life in CT = (X ~ X′ | preserved structure across Δt + responsive deformation)
Then:
    Other = Life ≈ trajectory of morphic identity
Then:
    Empathy = (Self ~ Life-of-Other | CT-preserving map)

Not simulation. Not mirroring.
But structural resonance with their inner Δt — their way of deforming under contrast (the morphic system)

That’s why:
    Empathy can fail
When:
    The other’s Δt is inaccessible
    Their contrast space is alien
    Their deformation axises is non-homeomorphic
