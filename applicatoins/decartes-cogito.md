# Reinterpretation of Decartes's Cogito through CT in CTL:

"I think therefore i am"

if doubter = identity, loop(doubter) → indeterminacy 
(I'm doubting A,B,C.. At some point, it starts to ask I am doubting I'm doubting A,B,C,.,.)

To be meaningfully a doubter needs to be observed, which prevents from getting stuck to indeterminacy

"I think therefore i am" = (doubter ~ observer | Δt)

more realistically
(doubter ~ observer | underlining frame called self & Δt)

(self & Δt)= Identity

More abstractly, doubter and observer → variability and invariability
(variability and invariability | identity) is who I am.
