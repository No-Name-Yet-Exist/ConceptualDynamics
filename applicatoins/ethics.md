# What is ethics?

Ethic might not exist as it is. You are homeomorphism of others, which include you in the future T(you), hurting others mean you hurt yourself.
If you don't have homeomorphism with others, you can do unethical things.
You can kill people at war because they are non-homeomorphic. (They ~ you | rupture)

Ethics = C(Self, Other, Z) = True
Where Z is the contrast frame, which can indicate/hint they are continuum.
→ Then hurting Other = hurting Self

“I hurt you because you're part of me.”
If the person hurts himself, he can hurt the other. It's homeomorphic symmetry of inversion
(ethical ~ unethical | rupture)

If:
    (Self ~ Other | Z) and (Self ≉ Self′ | Δt, self-harm, trauma)
then:
    You can hurt others as you do to yourself since you ~ others

CT-ethical responsibility might be that don't hurt yourself, Otherwise it validates to hurt others.

Try to be conscious of the morphic system or morphic path with others. Don't hurt others otherwise it validates them to hurt you.
