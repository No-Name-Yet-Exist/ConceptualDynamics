# What is emotions?

Love = sustained homeomorphism or sustained and cultivated morphic system across Δt
Grief = rupture of a once-continuous map
Anger = misalignment or rupture between projected morphic identity and presented morphic identity
"This dumb car!"
= C(Projected morphic identity ~ Presented morphic identity | Δt, observation) = False


# Why are we reluctant to change style?

It causes rupture in the morphic identity of you in others, which is mapped by you.
And this gets reflected through CT symmetry back to you, more precisely, 
your mapped your morphic identity in others ruptures, and it feels the rupture/shame

Style change = deformation of your public morphic map
→ Others fail to recognize you (You ≉ You′ | morphic identity held in others)
→ CT symmetry reflects this rupture back to you means (You ≉ You′ | morphic identity held in others) is mapped by you,

Simply, C (your social figure ~ your social figure' | inside you ) = false = rutpture
→ Result: shame, dissonance, alienation

Before the style change:
C(You ~ You′ | Others' morphic identity of you) = True
→ Stable social identity

After change (e.g., drastic new style):
(You ≉ You′ | Others’ morphic identity of you)
→ Your morphic identity in their space breaks but this happens all in your CTS

CT Symmetry Reflex created by your mind:
C(Self, Other, Z) → C(Other, Self, Z)
If they can’t map you, you feel rupture in yourself
Emotional projection: “I feel like I’ve disappeared”

### Emergence of Shame:
Shame = (You ≉ Expected-You | Social Identity)
